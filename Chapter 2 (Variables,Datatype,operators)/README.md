🔥**What is a Variable in Python?**
A Variable is a container used to store data or information that can change during program execution.

✅ **Definition**
A variable is like a name that refers to a value. It holds data that can be used and modified later.

🎯 **Example Understanding**
Think of a variable like a box where you can store different types of items (numbers, text, etc.).

🔑**Key Points About Variables:**
-Variables are used to store data.
-They are created by assigning a value using the = sign.
-Variable names must be unique.
-Python automatically decides the data type based on the value assigned.
-Variable names are case-sensitive.

**Example:**
If you write:
name = "Urmi"
Here, name is a variable and "Urmi" is the value stored inside it.

📌 **Conclusion**
Variables are the building blocks of any Python program, making data storage and manipulation easy!


Basic **Arithmetic Operations** in Python 🐍
This project demonstrates simple arithmetic operations using Python.

Code Explanation:


**Addition**
```python
a = 1
b = 8
print(a + b)  # Output: 9
```

**Subtraction**
```python
a = 5
b = 2
print(a - b)  # Output: 3
```

**Multiplication**
```python
a = 9
b = 3
print(a * b)  # Output: 27
```

**Division**
```python
a = 256
b = 4
print(a / b)  # Output: 64.0
```

📌 **What You'll Learn:**
Addition ➡️ +
Subtraction ➡️ -
Multiplication ➡️ *
Division ➡️ / (Returns result in float)
🎯 Output:
9
3
27
64.0

✅ This project is perfect for beginners to understand arithmetic operations in Python.



02_datatypes.py
📌 Data Types in Python
This code demonstrates different data types in Python.

Code Explanation:
a = 5        # a is an Integer (Whole Number)
b = 2.55     # b is a Float (Decimal Number)
c = "Urmi"   # c is a String (Text)
d = False    # d is a Boolean (True or False Value)
e = None     # e is a NoneType (Represents No Value)




03_rules.py

✅ Rules of Variable Names in Python (Also Applies to Other Identifiers)
In Python, variable names and identifiers (like function names, class names) must follow certain rules:

🔑 Rules:
Must Start with a Letter (A-Z or a-z) or an Underscore _

✅ Example: name, _value
❌ Invalid: 1name, #value
Cannot Start with a Number

✅ Example: number1
❌ Invalid: 1number
Only Letters, Numbers, and Underscores Allowed

✅ Example: user_name, age1
❌ Invalid: user-name, user@name
Case-Sensitive

Name and name are two different variables.
No Spaces Allowed

Use underscore _ instead.
✅ Example: user_name
❌ Invalid: user name
Cannot Use Python Reserved Keywords

Keywords like class, if, else, while, for, etc.
❌ Invalid: if = 10
Variable Names Should Be Meaningful (Recommended)

✅ Example: student_age
❌ Invalid: x, y
