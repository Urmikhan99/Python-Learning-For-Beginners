#  What is Precedence and Expression in Python?
# ðŸ”¥ 1. Precedence (Operator Precedence)
# ðŸ‘‰ Precedence means the priority order in which Python executes operators in an expression.

# ðŸ“Œ If there are multiple operators in one expression, Python follows a priority rule to decide which operator will be executed first.
# Here, * (Multiplication) has higher precedence than + (Addition).
# First, 5 * 2 = 10 will be calculated.
# Then, 10 + 10 = 20.

# ðŸ”¥ 2. Expression
# ðŸ‘‰ Expression is a combination of Operators and Operands that produces a result.

#  Easy Tip to Remember:
# ðŸ‘‰ BODMAS Rule

# B â†’ Brackets
# O â†’ Order (Power **)
# D â†’ Division /
# M â†’ Multiplication *
# A â†’ Addition +
# S â†’ Subtraction -
