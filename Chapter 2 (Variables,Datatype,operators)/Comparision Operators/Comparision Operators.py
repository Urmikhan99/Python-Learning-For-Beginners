# How it Works:
# In Python, comparison operators like >= can be used to compare strings.

# ðŸ‘‰ When comparing strings, Python compares their ASCII values (Letter by Letter).

# How the Comparison Happens:
# The first letter of x â†’ 'apple' â†’ a (ASCII = 97)
# The first letter of y â†’ 'apricot' â†’ a (ASCII = 97)
# Since the first letters are equal, Python checks the second letter:

# Second letter in 'apple' â†’ p (ASCII = 112)
# Second letter in 'apricot' â†’ p (ASCII = 112)
# They are equal again! âœ…

# Now Python checks the third letter:

# Third letter in 'apple' â†’ p (ASCII = 112)
# Third letter in 'apricot' â†’ r (ASCII = 114)
# Result:
# ðŸ‘‰ Since p is smaller than r, the condition apple >= apricot will return:False


# Important Rule:
# Python compares strings alphabetically.
# The comparison is Case-Sensitive.
# Small letters (a-z) have higher ASCII values than capital letters (A-Z).
# What is ASCII = 112?
